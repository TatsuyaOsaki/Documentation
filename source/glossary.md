# Glossary

**AXI** (Advanced eXtensible Interface) : parallel high-performance communication interface mainly designed for on chip communication (i.e. between ARM processor and FPGA on Zynq).

**BD** (Buffer Descriptor) : buffer descriptor are used in virutal queue process like AXI DMA.

**CPU** (Central Processing Unit) : can be simply called processor, it is a chip that performs tasks through a list of instructions usually to control other components.

**DMA** (Direct Memory Access) : direct memory acess between memory and AXI-4 stream target peripherals.

**DSP** (Digital Signal Processor) : processor specialised in numeric data computing, it is optimised for pipelined or parallel calculations of large data set (multiplications, divisions, ...).  

**EMIO** (Extended Multiplexed Input/Output) : signal used to exploit IOP controllers available in PS to make direct communication between PS and PL or to interact with the external IOPs via PL in case if all the MIO pins are occupied

**FDRE** : D Flip-Flop with Clock Enable and Synchronous Reset

**FPGA** (Field Programmable Gate Array) : reprogrammable integrated circuit.

**FSBL** (First Stage BootLoader) : boot Zynq device with optionnal FPGA configuration and loading application code.

**GIC** (Generic Interrupt Controller) : used for PS side interrupts, (Xintc for PL)

**GPIO** (General Purpose Input/Output) : i.e. led, push buttons, switchs ...

**IOP** (Input Output Peripheral) :

**MIO** (Multiplexed Input/Output) : pin used by PS to interact with external IOP (i.e. I2C, CAN, ...)

**PL** (Programmable Logic) : programmable logic of a Zynq relates to the FPGA

**PS** (Processing System) : processing system of a Zynq relates to the ARM processor

**RTL** (Register Transfer Level) : digital portions of a design (synchronous logic, combinatory logic, registers, ...), RTL is usually generated by VHDL/Verilog.

**SoC** (System on Chip) : integrated circuit that implements electronic system (almost always includes processor).

**VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) : description language used to generate hardware design.

**Zynq** : Xilinx SoC that integrates ARM-based processor with FPGA and hardware acceleration (CPU, DSP, ...)
