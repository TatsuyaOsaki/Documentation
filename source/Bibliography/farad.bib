abstract = {State-of-the-art software tools for neuronal network simulations scale to the largest computing systems available today and enable investigations of large-scale networks of up to 10% of the human cortex at a resolution of individual neurons and synapses. Due to an upper limit on the number of incoming connections of a single neuron, network connectivity becomes extremely sparse at this scale. To manage computational costs, simulation software ultimately targeting the brain scale needs to fully exploit this sparsity. Here we present a two-tier connection infrastructure and a framework for directed communication among compute nodes accounting for the sparsity of brain-scale networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing the technology in the NEST simulation code and we investigate its performance in different scaling scenarios of typical network simulations. Our results show that the new data structures and communication scheme prepare the simulation kernel for post-petascale high-performance computing facilities without sacrificing performance in smaller systems.},

abstract = {Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a medical emergency and can represent a life-threatening complication for hematology patients treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens. In clinical practice, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and other investigations which aim to identify a causative organism or site of infection is low. We have retrospectively examined all blood cultures collected in a "real world" cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia and patients with aggressive lymphoma treated with Hyper-CVAD/MTX-cytarabine, at a single tertiary center over a five-year period. In this cohort, the 30-day mortality following confirmed blood stream infection (BSI) was 5.9%, which is lower than most reports in the recent literature. We compared the blood culture results of inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy and outpatients presenting with fevers and found a significantly higher rate of proven BSI in the outpatient group. In all settings, gram-negative organisms were most common. The rate of resistance to first-line empiric antibiotics among pathogenic isolates was 11.6% in the whole cohort, independent of blood culture circumstances. There was a trend to higher resistance rates among inpatients undergoing induction chemotherapy compared to patients presenting to the emergency department (17.4% vs 7.5%) but this did not reach statistical significance. We also report low rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (5% of isolates), in a center where universal fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is not employed. Our low resistance and mortality rates support our current therapeutic strategies, however presence of resistant organisms across the spectrum of indications for BC collection highlights the importance of surveilling local patterns, escalating antimicrobial therapy in the deteriorating patient, and considering advanced techniques for the rapid identification of resistance in this patient population.},

abstract = {The rapid development of information technology has led to urgent requirements for high efficiency and ultralow power consumption. In the past few decades, neuromorphic computing has drawn extensive attention due to its promising capability in processing massive data with extremely low power consumption. Here, we offer a comprehensive review on emerging artificial neuromorphic devices and their applications. In light of the inner physical processes, we classify the devices into nine major categories and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We will show that anion/cation migration-based memristive devices, phase change, and spintronic synapses have been quite mature and possess excellent stability as a memory device, yet they still suffer from challenges in weight updating linearity and symmetry. Meanwhile, the recently developed electrolyte-gated synaptic transistors have demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency, linearity, and symmetry, but their stability and scalability still need to be optimized. Other emerging synaptic structures, such as ferroelectric, metal-insulator transition based, photonic, and purely electronic devices also have limitations in some aspects, therefore leading to the need for further developing high-performance synaptic devices. Additional efforts are also demanded to enhance the functionality of artificial neurons while maintaining a relatively low cost in area and power, and it will be of significance to explore the intrinsic neuronal stochasticity in computing and optimize their driving capability, etc. Finally, by looking into the correlations between the operation mechanisms, material systems, device structures, and performance, we provide clues to future material selections, device designs, and integrations for artificial synapses and neurons.},

abstract = {Spontaneous episodic activity is a general feature of developing neural networks. In the chick spinal cord, the activity comprises episodes of rhythmic discharge (duration 5-90 sec; cycle rate 0.1-2 Hz) that recur every 2-30 min. The activity does not depend on specialized connectivity or intrinsic bursting neurons and is generated by a network of functionally excitatory connections. Here, we develop an idealized, qualitative model of a homogeneous, excitatory recurrent network that could account for the multiple time-scale spontaneous activity in the embryonic chick spinal cord. We show that cycling can arise from the interplay between excitatory connectivity and fast synaptic depression. The slow episodic behavior is attributable to a slow activity-dependent network depression that is modeled either as a modulation of cellular excitability or as synaptic depression. Although the two descriptions share many features, the model with a slow synaptic depression accounts better for the experimental observations during blockade of excitatory synapses.},

Simulations, however, require a detailed specification of the model, including the nerve cell action potential and synaptic transmission. We describe a neuron model of intermedi- ate complexity, with a small number of compartments representing the soma and the dendritic tree, and equipped with Na +, K +, Ca 2+, and Ca 2+ dependent K + channels. Conductance changes in the different com- partments are used to model conventional excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions. Voltage dependent NMDA-receptor channels are also included, and influ- ence both the electrical conductance and the inflow of Ca 2{\S} ions. This neuron model has been designed for the analysis of neural networks and specifically for the simulation of the network generating locomotion in a simple vertebrate, the lamprey. By assigning experimen- tally established properties to the simulated cells and their synapses, it has been possible to verify the suffi- ciency of these properties to account for a number of experimental findings of the network in operation. The model is, however, sufficiently general to be useful for realistic simulation also of other neural systems.},

Subjectively, recognition of familiar objects and scenes appears to be virtually instantaneous, but measuring this processing time experimentally has proved difficult. Behavioural measures such as reaction times can be used, but these include not only visual processing but also the time required for response execution. However, event-related potentials (ERPs) can sometimes reveal signs of neural processing well before the motor output. Here we use a go/no-go categorization task in which subjects have to decide whether a previously unseen photograph, flashed on for just 20 ms, contains an animal. ERP analysis revealed a frontal negativity specific to no-go trials that develops roughly 150 ms after stimulus onset. We conclude that the visual processing needed to perform this highly demanding task can be achieved in under 150 ms.},

The control strain continuously presented 70% of type 2 fibres whereas the mdx strain showed an increase to 80% at 6 weeks and a subsequent decline. In mdx muscles, necrosis which begins at 3 weeks of age did not affect specifically one type of fibre. Type grouping was never observed when muscle regeneration occurred. Fibres of intermediate type (1C and 2C) were found continuously up to 52 weeks of age in the mdx mutant. The foci of small immature regenerating fibres were of type 2C but never 1C. A few mature fibres were either of type 2C or 1C. We suggest that the presence of intermediate type fibres could result from the co-expression of type 1 and 2 myosin heavy chains, indicating a transition from type 2 to type 1 in regenerating fibres. {\textcopyright} 1993 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The low-threshold calcium current (IT) underlies burst generation in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and plays a central role in the genesis of synchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located IT in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

abstract = {Energy demand is an important constraint on neural signaling. Several methods have been proposed to assess the energy budget of the brain based on a bottom-up approach in which the energy demand of individual biophysical processes are first estimated independently and then summed up to compute the brain's total energy budget. Here, we address this question using a novel approach that makes use of published datasets that reported average cerebral glucose and oxygen utilization in humans and rodents during different activation states. Our approach allows us (1) to decipher neuron-glia compartmentalization in energy metabolism and (2) to compute a precise state-dependent energy budget for the brain. Under the assumption that the fraction of energy used for signaling is proportional to the cycling of neurotransmitters, we find that in the activated state, most of the energy ( approximately 80%) is oxidatively produced and consumed by neurons to support neuron-to-neuron signaling. Glial cells, while only contributing for a small fraction to energy production ( approximately 6%), actually take up a significant fraction of glucose (50% or more) from the blood and provide neurons with glucose-derived energy substrates. Our results suggest that glycolysis occurs for a significant part in astrocytes whereas most of the oxygen is utilized in neurons. As a consequence, a transfer of glucose-derived metabolites from glial cells to neurons has to take place. Furthermore, we find that the amplitude of this transfer is correlated to (1) the activity level of the brain; the larger the activity, the more metabolites are shuttled from glia to neurons and (2) the oxidative activity in astrocytes; with higher glial pyruvate metabolism, less metabolites are shuttled from glia to neurons. While some of the details of a bottom-up biophysical approach have to be simplified, our method allows for a straightforward assessment of the brain's energy budget from macroscopic measurements with minimal underlying assumptions.},

abstract = {In human brain, short-term physiological stimulation results in dramatic and proportional increase in blood flow and metabolic rate of glucose but minimal change in oxygen utilization, however, with continuing stimulation, we have observed that blood flow response diminishes and oxygen utilization increases. Given the temporal limitation of conventional methods to measure glucose metabolism in the human brain, we modified [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET paradigm to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of visual stimulation on human brain glucose metabolism. In the present study, seven healthy volunteers each underwent three dynamic FDG PET studies: at rest and after 1 min and 15 min of visual stimulation (using reversing black-white checkerboard) which continued for only 5 min after FDG injection. We found that increase in FDG uptake in the visual cortex was attenuated by 28% when preceded by 15 min of continuous visual stimulation (p < 0.001). This decline in metabolism occurred in the absence of any behavior changes in task performance. The similarity in behavior of blood flow and glucose metabolism over time supports the hypothesis that, in activated brain, blood flow is modulated by changes in cytosolic free NADH/NAD+ ratio related to increased glycolysis. Furthermore, the observed decline in glucose metabolism may reflect a shift from glycolytic to oxidative glucose metabolism with continued activation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Biological neural networks outperform current computer technology in terms of power consumption and computing speed while performing associative tasks, such as pattern recognition. The analogue and massive parallel in-memory computing in biology differs strongly from conventional transistor electronics that rely on the von Neumann architecture. Therefore, novel bio-inspired computing architectures have been attracting a lot of attention in the field of neuromorphic computing. Here, memristive devices, which serve as non-volatile resistive memory, are employed to emulate the plastic behaviour of biological synapses. In particular, CMOS integrated resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices are promising candidates to extend conventional CMOS technology to neuromorphic systems. However, dealing with the inherent stochasticity of resistive switching can be challenging for network performance. In this work, the probabilistic switching is exploited to emulate stochastic plasticity with fully CMOS integrated binary RRAM devices. Two different RRAM technologies with different device variabilities are investigated in detail, and their potential applications in stochastic artificial neural networks (StochANNs) capable of solving MNIST pattern recognition tasks is examined. A mixed-signal implementation with hardware synapses and software neurons combined with numerical simulations shows that the proposed concept of stochastic computing is able to process analogue data with binary memory cells.},

Axon dysfunction occupies a central position in many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons. Recent findings suggest that the functional and computational repertoire of the axon is much richer than traditionally thought. Beyond classical axonal propagation, intrinsic voltage-gated ionic currents together with the geometrical properties of the axon determine several complex operations that not only control signal processing in brain circuits but also neuronal timing and synaptic efficacy. Recent evidence for the implication of these forms of axonal computation in the short-term dynamics of neuronal communication is discussed. Finally, we review how neuronal activity regulates both axon morphology and axonal function on a long-term time scale during development and adulthood.},

Could sleeping after goal encoding promote later execution? We evaluated this possibility by instructing participants to execute a prospective memory goal after a short delay (20 min), a 12-hr wake delay, or a 12-hr sleep delay. Goal execution declined after the 12-hr wake delay relative to the short delay. In contrast, goal execution was relatively preserved after the 12-hr sleep delay relative to the short delay. The sleep-enhanced goal execution was not accompanied by a decline in performance of an ongoing task in which the prospective memory goal was embedded, which suggests that the effect was not a consequence of attentional resources being reallocated from the ongoing task to the prospective memory goal. Our results suggest that consolidation processes active during sleep increase the probability that a goal will be spontaneously retrieved and executed. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

To enable SNNs to process information about natural images, we present a method to accelerate the spikes encoding on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

The neural mechanisms distinguishing CG from Noncomplicated Grief (NCG) are unclear, but hypothesized mechanisms include both pain-related activity (related to the social pain of loss) and reward-related activity (related to attachment behavior). Bereaved women (11 CG, 12 NCG) participated in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, during grief elicitation with idiographic stimuli. Analyses revealed that whereas both CG and NCG participants showed pain-related neural activity in response to reminders of the deceased, only those with CG showed reward-related activity in the nucleus accumbens (NA). This NA cluster was positively correlated with self-reported yearning, but not with time since death, participant age, or positive/negative affect. This study supports the hypothesis that attachment activates reward pathways.

Mathematical models of neurons have been widely used to simulate synchronization behavior and analyze its mechanisms. Common stochastic inputs are considered to be effective in facilitating synchronization. However, the mechanisms of how partial reset affects neuronal synchronization are still not well understood. In this paper, the synchronization of Stein's model neurons with partial reset is studied. The differences in synchronization mechanisms between neurons with full reset and those with partial reset are analyzed, and the findings lead to the novel concept of transient synchronization. Furthermore, it is proven analytically that due to common stochastic inputs, Stein's model neurons with different initial membrane potentials and partial reset achieve transient synchronization with probability 1. Additionally, a systematic numerical analysis is performed to explore the similarities and differences between full reset and partial reset regarding model parameters, synchronization time, and desynchronization behavior. Thus, partial reset is a powerful and flexible tool that facilitates neuronal synchronization while reserving the possibility of desynchronization. Our analysis also provides an alternative approach to analyze neurons of the integrate-and-fire family and a theoretical complement implying possible information encoding mechanisms in the brain.},

abstract = {The Inferior-Olivary nucleus (ION) is a well-charted region of the brain, heavily associated with sensorimotor control of the body. It comprises ION cells with unique properties which facilitate sensory processing and motor-learning skills. Various simulation models of ION-cell networks have been written in an attempt to unravel their mysteries. However, simulations become rapidly intractable when biophysically plausible models and meaningful network sizes (≥100 cells) are modeled. To overcome this problem, in this work we port a highly detailed ION cell network model, originally coded in Matlab, onto an FPGA chip. It was first converted to ANSI C code and extensively profiled. It was, then, translated to HLS C code for the Xilinx Vivado toolflow and various al-gorithmic and arithmetic optimizations were applied. The design was implemented in a Virtex 7 (XC7VX485T) de-vice and can simulate a 96-cell network at real-time speed, yielding a speedup of ×700 compared to the original Matlab code and ×12.5 compared to the reference C implementation running on a Intel Xeon 2.66GHz machine with 20GB RAM. For a 1,056-cell network (non-real-time), an FPGA speedup of ×45 against the C code can be achieved, demonstrat-ing the design's usefulness in accelerating neuroscience re-search. Limited by the available on-chip memory, the FPGA can maximally support a 14,400-cell network (non-real-time) with online parameter configurability for cell state and net-work size. The maximum throughput of the FPGA ION-network accelerator can reach 2.13 GFLOPS.},

abstract = {Neural activity and behavior in laboratory experiments are surprisingly variable across trials. This variability and its potential causes have been the focus of a spirited debate. Here we review recent research that has shed light on the sources of neural variability and its impact on behavior. We explain how variability may arise from incomplete knowledge about an animal's internal states and its environment. We discuss the problem of incomplete knowledge both from the experimenter's point of view and from the animal's point of view. Both view points are illustrated through several examples from the literature. We furthermore consider both mechanistic and normative models that explain how neural and behavioral variability may be linked. Finally, we review why variability may confer an adaptive advantage to organisms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews recent advances in the understanding of neurochemical transmission and efficient models to incorporate synaptic interactions in neuronal models. After a brief introduction on the different types of ion channels and their gating mechanisms, the first section focuses on the mechanisms of transmitter release by presynaptic terminals. A detailed model of the release process is presented, as well as a simplified representation of the properties of release. The second section reviews detailed models for the most prominent "fast" receptor types in the CNS (AMPA, NMDA, GABA_A) as well as neuromodulators (with GABA_B receptors as a prototype). The next section provides the reader with simplified representations of these currents that are fast to compute while capturing the most salient features of AMPA, NMDA, GABA_A and GABA_B receptor-mediated neurotransmission. For both detailed and simplified models, the kinetic models are compared to experimental data. The last section gives practical implementations of the simplified models, by illustrating the summation of synaptic events for the different types of receptors. An example is also presented for network simulations in which synaptic interactions are represented by kinetic models. Finally, the appendixes gives more formal details on the kinetic representation of gating mechanisms, the procedures used to fit the models to experimental data, and optimized algorithms to implement kinetic synapse models at low computational cost.},

abstract = {We have calculated periodic solutions to the space-clamped Hodgkin-Huxley equations for constant applied depolarizing current I. For each I, Iv<I<I2, there is a stable periodic solution which corresponds to repetitive firing. For I<I1 and I>I2, where Iv<I1, the unique singular point is stable; for other values of I it is unstable. These results have been found by other investigators as well. In the overlap range Iv<I<I1, where a stable periodic solution and a stable singular point coexist, we have verified computationally the conjecture that there is an additional periodic solution which is unstable. In an analysis of linear stability we demonstrate instability by direct calculation of growth rates of unstable modes. The two sets of periodic solutions (stable and unstable) form one continuous family with two limbs which coalesce at I=Iv. The periodic solutions emerge with zero amplitude through Hopf bifurcation for I=I1,I2. The temperature dependence of the solutions is examined. For 6.3°C the limb of unstable solutions has a curious switchback region so that for some I values this limb exhibits three unstable limit cycles. Moreover, additional branches of unstable periodic solutions emerge from this region through successive period-doubling bifurcations. The numerical method we use to calculate a periodic solution is insensitive to the stability of the solution; a full description is provided. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {Contraction-level invariant surface electromyography pattern recognition introduces the decrease of training time and decreases the limitation of clinical prostheses. This study intended to examine whether a signal pre-processing method named frequency division technique (FDT) for online myoelectric pattern recognition classification is robust against contraction-level variation, and whether this pre-processing method has an advantage over traditional time-domain pattern recognition techniques even in the absence of muscle contraction-level variation. Eight healthy and na{\"{i}}ve subjects performed wrist contractions during two degrees of freedom goal-oriented tasks, divided in three groups of type I, type II, and type III. The performance of these tasks, when the two different methods were used, was quantified by completion rate, completion time, throughput, efficiency, and overshoot. The traditional and the FDT method were compared in four runs, using combinations of normal or high muscle contraction level, and the traditional method or FDT. The results indicated that FDT had an advantage over traditional methods in the tested real-time myoelectric control tasks. FDT had a much better median completion rate of tasks (95%) compared to the traditional method (77.5%) among non-perfect runs, and the variability in FDT was strikingly smaller than the traditional method (p < 0.001). Moreover, the FDT method outperformed the traditional method in case of contraction-level variation between the training and online control phases (p = 0. 005 for throughput in type I tasks with normal contraction level, p = 0.006 for throughput in type II tasks, and p = 0.001 for efficiency with normal contraction level of all task types). This study shows that FDT provides advantages in online myoelectric control as it introduces robustness over contraction-level variations.},

We discuss the effect of different layer-types on memory organization and outline how different memory organization schemes are impacted by the SNN layertype.

@article{Zoli2002,
abstract = {Interneuronal communication in the central nervous system (CNS) have always been of basic importance for theories on the cerebral morphofunctional architecture. Our group has proposed that intercellular communication in the brain can be grouped into 2 broad classes based on some general features of the transmission: wiring (WT) and volume (VT) transmission. WT occurs via a relatively constrained cellular chain (wire), while VT consists of 3-dimensional diffusion of signals in the extracellular fluid (ECF) for distances larger than the synaptic cleft. Both morphological and functional evidence indicates that dopamine (DA) synapses in striatum are `open' synapses, i.e., synapses which favor diffusion of the transmitter into the surrounding ECF and observations are compatible with the view that DA varicosities can synthesize, store and release DA for VT. The DAergic mesostriatal transmission has, therefore, been examined by several groups to give experimental support to VT. Moreover, due to its minor structural requirements, VT may become prevalent under some pathological conditions, e. g. Parkinson's disease. In animal models of DAergic pathway degeneration, it has been shown that a compensatory activation of surviving DA terminals may lead to a preferential potentiation of VT. WT and VT favor different and complementary types of computation. VT is markedly slower and less safe than WT, but has minor spatial constraints and allows the reach of a large number of targets. Models of neuronal systems integrating classical neuronal circuits and diffusible signals begin to show how WT and VT may interact in the neural tissue.},

Here, we demonstrate an all-inorganic flexible artificial synapse enabled by a ferroelectric field effect transistor based on mica. The device not only exhibits excellent electrical pulse modulated conductance updating for synaptic functions but also shows remarkable mechanical flexibility and high temperature reliability, making robust neuromorphic computation possible under external disturbances such as stress and heating. Based on its linear, repeatable, and stable long-term plasticity, we simulate an artificial neural network for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digit recognition with an accuracy of 94.4%.

Neuroscience research is certain to prove a vital element in combating mental illness in its various incarnations, a strategic battleground in the future of medicine, as the prevalence of mental disorders is becoming better understood each year. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are affected by mental, behavioral, neurological and substance use disorders. The World Health Organization estimated in 2002 that 154 million people globally suffer from depression and 25 million people from schizophrenia; 91 million people are affected by alcohol use disorders and 15 million by drug use disorders. A more recent WHO report shows that 50 million people suffer from epilepsy and 24 million from Alzheimer's and other dementias. Because neuroscience takes the etiology of disease-the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors-as its object of inquiry, it is increasingly valuable in understanding an array of medical conditions. A recent report by the United States' Surgeon General cites several such diseases: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, early-onset depression, autism, attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, anorexia nervosa, and panic disorder, among many others. Not only is this volume a boon to those wishing to understand the future of neuroscience, it also aims to encourage the initiation of neuroscience programs in developing countries, featuring as it does an appendix full of advice on how to develop such programs. With broad coverage of both basic science and clinical issues, comprising 106 chapters from a diversity of international authors and including complementary video components, Neuroscience in the 21st Century will serve as a comprehensive resource to students and researchers alike.},

abstract = {Relational memory, the flexible ability to generalize across existing stores of information, is a fundamental property of human cognition. Little is known, however, about how and when this inferential knowledge emerges. Here, we test the hypothesis that human relational memory develops during offline time periods. Fifty-six participants initially learned five "premise pairs" (A>B, B>C, C>D, D>E, and E>F). Unknown to subjects, the pairs contained an embedded hierarchy (A>B>C>D>E>F). Following an offline delay of either 20 min, 12 hr (wake or sleep), or 24 hr, knowledge of the hierarchy was tested by examining inferential judgments for novel "inference pairs" (B>D, C>E, and B>E). Despite all groups achieving near-identical premise pair retention after the offline delay (all groups, >85%; the building blocks of the hierarchy), a striking dissociation was evident in the ability to make relational inference judgments: the 20-min group showed no evidence of inferential ability (52%), whereas the 12- and 24-hr groups displayed highly significant relational memory developments (inference ability of both groups, >75%; P < 0.001). Moreover, if the 12-hr period contained sleep, an additional boost to relational memory was seen for the most distant inferential judgment (the B>E pair; sleep = 93%, wake = 69%, P = 0.03). Interestingly, despite this increase in performance, the sleep benefit was not associated with an increase in subjective confidence for these judgments. Together, these findings demonstrate that human relational memory develops during offline time delays. Furthermore, sleep appears to preferentially facilitate this process by enhancing hierarchical memory binding, thereby allowing superior performance for the more distant inferential judgments, a benefit that may operate below the level of conscious awareness. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

However, current robots are still far from being able to handle multiple tasks in a dynamic environment as efficiently as humans. To cope with complexity and variability, further progress toward scalability and adaptability are essential for intelligent robots. Here, we report a brain-inspired robotic platform implemented by an unmanned bicycle that exhibits scalability of network scale, quantity and diversity to handle the changing needs of different scenarios. The platform adopts rich coding schemes and a trainable and scalable neural state machine, enabling flexible cooperation of hybrid networks. In addition, an embedded system is developed using a cross-paradigm neuromorphic chip to facilitate the implementation of diverse neural networks in spike or non-spike form. The platform achieved various real-time tasks concurrently in different real-world scenarios, providing a new pathway to enhance robots' intelligence.},

abstract = {A precise firing sequence (PFS) is defined here as a sequence of three spikes with fixed delays (up to some time accuracy $\Delta$), that repeat excessively. This paper provides guidelines for detecting PFSs, verifying their significance through surrogate spike trains, and identifying existing PFSs. The method is based on constructing a three-fold correlation among spikes, estimating the expected shape of the correlation by smoothing, and detecting points for which the correlations significantly protrude above the expected correlation. Validation is achieved by generating surrogate spike trains in which the time of each of the real spikes is randomly jittered within a small time window. The method is extensively tested through application to simulated spike trains, and the results are illustrated with recordings of single units in the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Pitfalls which may cause false detection of PFSs, or loss of existing PFSs, include searching for PFSs in which the same neuron participates more than once, and attempting to produce a surrogate with some fixed statistical property.

abstract = {The low-threshold calcium current (IT) underlies burst generation in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and plays a central role in the genesis of synchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located IT in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of monthly intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) secondary to angioid streaks (AS) in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).\n\nDESIGN: Twelve-month prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, nonrandomized interventional clinical trial.\n\nMETHODS: In 7 patients, 1 eye with an active CNV was injected with 0.5 mg ranibizumab monthly over 1 year. Distance and reading visual acuity, reading speed, angiographic findings, and central retinal thickness (CRT) on optical coherence tomography were assessed at each visit. Central retinal light increment sensitivity (LIS) was assessed by microperimetry at baseline, at 6 months, and 3 to 4 months after the last injection.\n\nRESULTS: Best-corrected visual acuity increased significantly from baseline to month 12 (20/63 or 61 ETDRS letters to 20/32 or 73 ETDRS letters; P = .012). The effect was maintained 3 months later (61 ETDRS letters to 72 ETDRS letters; P = .055). Reading acuity and speed could be maintained throughout the study. Central LIS improved (6.6 dB, SD ± 5.9 at baseline to 7.4 dB, SD ± 6.2 at last follow-up; P < .001). Leakage from active CNVs subsided. Mean change in CRT from baseline to month 12 and 15 was -86 $\mu$m (P = .074) and -65 $\mu$m (P = .182), respectively. No serious adverse events occurred.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Efficacy outcomes indicate a beneficial therapeutic effect of intravitreal ranibizumab on central visual function including retinal LIS. Both the functional and morphologic response based on angiographic and OCT findings to ranibizumab treatment implicate an important pathophysiological role of vascular endothelial growth factor in CNVs secondary to AS in PXE. Intravitreal ranibizumab appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment in these patients.},

abstract = {Modeling synaptic transmission between neurons is a challenging task. Since many physiological processes contribute to synaptic transmission (figure 6.1), computa- tional models require numerous simplifications and abstractions. Furthermore, since synapses change their properties on many time scales, synaptic transmission is also a highly dynamic process. In addition, synaptic transmission is stochastic and believed to be an important source of noise in the nervous system. Finally, because the num- ber of synapses in any decent-sized network is large (chapter 13), e‰cient simulation routines are important. The human brain is estimated to contain some 1014 synapses. Even if all synapses were identical, modeling them would present a substantial computational challenge. Moreover, synaptic connections in the central nervous system are highly diverse. This diversity is not simply due to random variability, but most likely reflects a highly specified and precise design. For example, the same presynaptic axon can give rise to synapses with di¤erent properties, depending on the type of the postsynaptic target neuron (Thomson et al., 1993; Thomson, 1997; Reyes et al., 1998; Markram et al., 1998). At the same time, synapses on a given postsynaptic dendrite can have dif- ferent properties, depending on their dendritic location and the identity of the pre- synaptic neuron (Walker et al., 2002). Moreover, synaptic e‰cacies are not static but have activity-dependent dynamics in the form of short-term (Zucker and Regehr, 2002) and long-term plasticity (Abbott and Nelson, 2000), which are the consequence of complex molecular net- works. Simulation of synaptic transmission therefore requires careful simplifications. This chapter describes models at di¤erent levels of realism and computational e‰- ciency for simulating synapses and their plasticity. We also review experimental data that provide the parameter values for the synapse models, focusing on the dom- inant transmitter and receptor types mediating fast synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system.},

[2007]: J Cogn Neurosci 19:1218-1230), revealing activation in the reward and motivation systems of the brain. In this study, we asked what systems are activated for early-stage romantic love in Easterners, specifically Chinese participants? Are these activations affected by individual differences within a cultural context of Traditionality and Modernity? Also, are these brain activations correlated with later satisfaction in the relationship? In Beijing, we used the same procedure used by Aron et al. (Aron et al. [2005]: J Neurophysiol 94:327-337). The stimuli for 18 Chinese participants were a picture of the face of their beloved, the face of a familiar acquaintance, and a countback task. We found significant activations specific to the beloved in the reward and motivation systems, particularly, the ventral tegmental area and the caudate. The mid-orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum were also activated, whereas amygdala, medial orbitofrontal, and medial accumbens activity were decreased relative to the familiar acquaintance. Self-reported Traditionality and Modernity scores were each positively correlated with activity in the nucleus accumbens, although in different regions and sides of the brain. Activity in the subgenual area and the superior frontal gyrus was associated with higher relationship happiness at 18-month follow-up. Our results show that midbrain dopamine-rich reward/motivation systems were activated by early-stage romantic love in Chinese participants, as found by other studies. Neural activity was associated with Traditionality and Modernity attitudes as well as with later relationship happiness for Chinese participants.

abstract = {Thalamic reticular (RE) neurons are involved in the genesis of synchronized thalamocortical oscillations, which depend in part on their complex bursting properties. We have investigated the intrinsic properties of RE cells using computational models based on morphological and electrophysiological data. Simulations of a reconstructed RE cells were compared directly with recordings from the same cell to obtain precise values for the passive parameters. In a first series of experiments, the low-threshold calcium current (I(Ts)) was studied via voltage clamp in acutely dissociated RE cells that lack most of their dendrites. Simulations based on a cell with truncated dendrites and Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics reproduced these recordings with a relatively low density of I(Ts). In a second series of experiments, voltage-clamp recordings obtained in intact RE cells in slices showed a higher amplitude and slower kinetics of I(Ts). These properties could be reproduced from the reconstructed cell model assuming higher densities of I(Ts) in distal dendrites. In a third series of experiments, current-clamp recordings were obtained on RE cells in vivo. The marked differences with in vitro recordings could be reconciled by simulating synaptic bombardment in the dendrites of RE cells, but only if they contained high distal densities of I(Ts). In addition, simpler models with as few as three compartments could reproduce the same behavior assuming dendritic I(Ts). These models and experiments show how intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells, as recorded in vivo and in vitro, may be explained by dendritic calcium currents.},

Presentations relating to the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve or muscle mean that channelopathies can impact on almost any area of neurological practice. Typically, neurological channelopathies are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and cause paroxysmal disturbances of neurological function, although the impairment of function can become fixed with time. These disorders are individually rare, but an accurate diagnosis is important as it has genetic counselling and often treatment implications. Furthermore, the study of less common ion channel mutation-related diseases has increased our understanding of pathomechanisms that is relevant to common neurological diseases such as migraine and epilepsy.

abstract = {The central nervous system receives a vast amount of sensory inputs, and it should be able to discriminate and recognize different kinds of multisensory information. Winner-take-all (WTA) consists of a simple recurrent neural network carrying out discrimination of input signals through competition. This paper presents a real-time scalable digital hardware implementation of the spiking WTA network. The need for concurrent computing, real-time performance, proper accuracy, and the reconfigurable device has led to the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as the target hardware platform. A set of techniques is employed to lessen memory and resource usage. The proposed architecture consists of multiprocessing elements, which share hardware resources between a specific number of neurons. We introduce a novel connectivity array for neurons (dedicated to the WTA network) to cut down memory usage. Also, a multiplier-less method in the neuron model and a novel tree adder in the synapse processing unit are designed to improve computational efficiency. The proposed network simulates 4,500 neurons in real time on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, while a scalable architecture facilitates the implementation of up to 20,000 neurons on this device. The pipeline structure can guarantee real-time performance for large-scale networks. Based on simulation and physical synthesis results, the presented network mimics biological WTA dynamics and consumes efficient hardware resources.},

abstract = {Recent results demonstrate techniques for fully quantitative, statistical inference of the dynamics of individual neurons under the Hodgkin–Huxley framework of voltage-gated conductances. Using a variational approximation, this approach has been successfully applied to simulated data from model neurons. Here, we use this method to analyze a population of real neurons recorded in a slice preparation of the zebra finch forebrain nucleus HVC. Our results demonstrate that using only 1,500 ms of voltage recorded while injecting a complex current waveform, we can estimate the values of 12 state variables and 72 parameters in a dynamical model, such that the model accurately predicts the responses of the neuron to novel injected currents. A less complex model produced consistently worse predictions, indicating that the additional currents contribute significantly to the dynamics of these neurons. Preliminary results indicate some differences in the channel complement of the models for different classes of HVC neurons, which accords with expectations from the biology. Whereas the model for each cell is incomplete (representing only the somatic compartment, and likely to be missing classes of channels that the real neurons possess), our approach opens the possibility to investigate in modeling the plausibility of additional classes of channels the cell might possess, thus improving the models over time. These results provide an important foundational basis for building biologically realistic network models, such as the one in HVC that contributes to the process of song production and developmental vocal learning in songbirds.},

The model consists of a pre-synaptic bouton, a post-synaptic dendritic spine-head, a synaptic cleft and a perisynaptic astrocyte controlling Ca 2+ dynamics inside the synaptic bouton. This in turn controls glutamate release dynamics in the cleft. As a consequence of this, glutamate concentration in the cleft has been modeled, in which glutamate reuptake by astrocytes has also been incorporated. Finally, dendritic spine-head dynamics has been modeled. As an application, this model clearly shows synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal region, i.e., astrocyte Ca 2+ mediates synaptic plasticity, which is in conformity with the majority of the recent findings (Perea and Araque (Science 317, 1083-1086, 2007); Henneberger et al.

abstract = {Human intelligence relies on the vast number of neurons and their interconnections that form a parallel computing engine. If we tend to design a brain-like machine, we will have no choice but to employ many spiking neurons, each one has a large number of synapses. Such a neuronal network is not only compute-intensive but also memory-intensive. The performance and the configurability of the modern FPGAs make them suitable hardware solutions to deal with these challenges. This paper presents a scalable architecture to simulate a randomly connected network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. To demonstrate that our architecture eliminates the need to use a high-end device, we employ the XC7A200T, a member of the mid-range Xilinx Artix(R)-7 family, as our target device. A set of techniques are proposed to reduce the memory usage and computational requirements. Here we introduce a multi-core architecture in which each core can update the states of a group of neurons stored in its corresponding memory bank. The proposed system uses a novel method to generate the connectivity vectors on the fly instead of storing them in a huge memory. This technique is based on a cyclic permutation of a single prestored connectivity vector per core. Moreover, to reduce both the resource usage and the computational latency even more, a novel approximate two-level counter is introduced to count the number of the spikes at the synapse for the sparse network. The first level is a low cost saturated counter implemented on FPGA lookup tables that reduces the number of inputs to the second level exact adder tree. It, therefore, results in much lower hardware cost for the counter circuit. These techniques along with pipelining make it possible to have a high-performance, scalable architecture, which could be configured for either a real-time simulation of up to 5120 neurons or a large-scale simulation of up to 65536 neurons in an appropriate execution time on a cost-optimized FPGA.},

abstract = {Hodgkin and Huxley (H-H) model for action potential generation has held firm for half a century because this relatively simple and experimentally testable model embodies the major features of membrane nonlinearity: namely, voltage-dependent ionic currents that activate and inactivate in time. However, experimental and theoretical developments of the past 20 years force one to re-evaluate its usefulness. First, the H-H model is, in its original form, limited to the two voltage-dependent currents found in the squid giant axon and it must be extended significantly if it is to deal with the excitable soma and dendrites of neurons. Second, the macroscopic and deterministic H-H model does not capture correctly the kinetics of the Na+ channel and it cannot account for the stochastic response to current injection that arises from the discrete nature of ion channels. Third, much simpler integrate-and-fire-type models seem to be more useful for exploring collective phenomena in neuronal networks. Is the H-H model threatened, or will it continue to set the fundamental framework for exploring neuronal excitability?},

abstract = {To explore the link between bioenergetics and motorneuron degeneration, we used a computational model in which detailed morphology and ion conductance are paired with intracellular ATP production and consumption. We found that reduced ATP availability increases the metabolic cost of a single action potential and disrupts K + /Na + homeostasis, resulting ina chronic depolarization. The magnitude of the ATP shortage at which this ionic instability occurs depends on the morphology and intrinsic conductance characteristic of the neuron. If ATP shortageisconfined to the distal part of the axon, the ensuinglocal ionic instability eventually spreads tothe wholeneuron and involves fasciculation-like spiking events. A shortage of ATP also causes a rise in intracellular calcium. Our modeling work supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction can account for salient features of the paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including motor neuronhyperexcitability, fasciculation, and differential vulnerability of motor neuron subpopulations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Social relationships are essential for maintaining human mental health, yet little is known about the brain mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of social bonds. Animal models are powerful tools for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms regulating the cognitive processes leading to the development of social relationships and for potentially extending our understanding of the human condition. In this review, we discuss the roles of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin in the regulation of social bonding as well as related social behaviors which culminate in the formation of social relationships in animal models. The formation of social bonds is a hierarchical process involving social motivation and approach, the processing of social stimuli and formation of social memories, and the social attachment itself. Oxytocin and vasopressin have been implicated in each of these processes. Specifically, these peptides facilitate social affiliation and parental nurturing behavior, are essential for social recognition in rodents, and are involved in the formation of selective mother-infant bonds in sheep and pair bonds in monogamous voles. The convergence of evidence from these animal studies makes oxytocin and vasopressin attractive candidates for the neural modulation of human social relationships as well as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders associated with disruptions in social behavior, including autism. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Such brain-inspired computing also provides a promising platform for the development of artificial general intelligence14,15. However, unlike conventional computing systems, which have a well established computer hierarchy built around the concept of Turing completeness and the von Neumann architecture16–18, there is currently no generalized system hierarchy or understanding of completeness for brain-inspired computing. This affects the compatibility between software and hardware, impairing the programming flexibility and development productivity of brain-inspired computing. Here we propose ‘neuromorphic completeness', which relaxes the requirement for hardware completeness, and a corresponding system hierarchy, which consists of a Turing-complete software-abstraction model and a versatile abstract neuromorphic architecture. Using this hierarchy, various programs can be described as uniform representations and transformed into the equivalent executable on any neuromorphic complete hardware—that is, it ensures programming-language portability, hardware completeness and compilation feasibility. We implement toolchain software to support the execution of different types of program on various typical hardware platforms, demonstrating the advantage of our system hierarchy, including a new system-design dimension introduced by the neuromorphic completeness. We expect that our study will enable efficient and compatible progress in all aspects of brain-inspired computing systems, facilitating the development of various applications, including artificial general intelligence.},

abstract = {In most neurons, Na+ channels in the axon are complemented by others localized in the soma and dendrites to ensure spike back-propagation. However, cerebellar granule cells are neurons with simplified architecture in which the dendrites are short and unbranched and a single thin ascending axon travels toward the molecular layer before bifurcating into parallel fibers. Here we show that in cerebellar granule cells, Na+ channels are enriched in the axon, especially in the hillock, but almost absent from soma and dendrites. The impact of this channel distribution on neuronal electroresponsiveness was investigated by multi-compartmental modeling. Numerical simulations indicated that granule cells have a compact electrotonic structure allowing excitatory postsynaptic potentials to diffuse with little attenuation from dendrites to axon. The spike arose almost simultaneously along the whole axonal ascending branch and invaded the hillock the activation of which promoted spike back-propagation with marginal delay (<200 $\mu$s) and attenuation (<20 mV) into the somato-dendritic compartment. These properties allow granule cells to perform submillisecond coincidence detection of pre- and postsynaptic activity and to rapidly activate Purkinje cells contacted by the axonal ascending branch.

abstract = {This study assesses the feasibility of latent factor analysis via dynamical systems (LFADS) for evaluating differences in the observed spiking response dynamics imposed by two electrical microstimulation regimes in awake rats. LFADS is a recently-developed deep learning method that uses stimulus-aligned neural spiking data to determine the initial neural state of each trial, as well as infer a set of time-dependent perturbations to the learned neural dynamics within trials. We show that time-dependent perturbations inferred by an LFADS model trained on spikes from trials on a single session can distinguish between different stimulation conditions. Furthermore, we use these data to exemplify how LFADS inferences track the evolution of stimulus-related spiking responses during chronic microstimulation experiments.},

abstract = {To tackle real-world challenges, deep and complex neural networks are generally used with a massive number of parameters, which require large memory size, extensive computational operations, and high energy consumption in neuromorphic hardware systems. In this work, we propose an unsupervised online adaptive weight pruning method that dynamically removes noncritical weights from a spiking neural network (SNN) to reduce network complexity and improve energy efficiency. The adaptive pruning method explores neural dynamics and firing activity of SNNs and adapts the pruning threshold over time and neurons during training. The proposed adaption scheme allows the network to effectively identify critical weights associated with each neuron by changing the pruning threshold dynamically over time and neurons. It balances the connection strength of neurons with the previous layer with adaptive thresholds and prevents weak neurons from failure after pruning. We also evaluated improvement in the energy efficiency of SNNs with our method by computing synaptic operations (SOPs). Simulation results and detailed analyses have revealed that applying adaption in the pruning threshold can significantly improve network performance and reduce the number of SOPs. The pruned SNN with 800 excitatory neurons can achieve a 30% reduction in SOPs during training and a 55% reduction during inference, with only 0.44% accuracy loss on MNIST dataset. Compared with a previously reported online soft pruning method, the proposed adaptive pruning method shows 3.33% higher classification accuracy and 67% more reduction in synaptic operations. The effectiveness of our method was confirmed on different datasets and for different network sizes. Our evaluation showed that the implementation overhead of the adaptive method regarding speed, area and energy is negligible in the network. Therefore, this work offers a promising solution for effective network compression and building highly energy-efficient neuromorphic systems in real-time applications.},

Models of plastic networks typically combine point neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as the learning rule. However, a point neuron does not capture the local non-linear processing of synaptic inputs allowed for by dendrites. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that STDP is not the only learning rule available to neurons. By implementing biophysically realistic neuron models, we study how dendrites enable multiple synaptic plasticity mechanisms to coexist in a single cell. In these models, we compare the conditions for STDP and for synaptic strengthening by local dendritic spikes. We also explore how the connectivity between two cells is affected by these plasticity rules and by different synaptic distributions. Finally, we show that how memory retention during associative learning can be prolonged in networks of neurons by including dendrites.},

abstract = {The thick-tufted layer 5b pyramidal cell extends its dendritic tree to all six layers of the mammalian neocortex and serves as a major building block for the cortical column. L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na(+)-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca(2+) spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca(2+) spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.},

abstract = {Neocortical neurons display a wide range of dendritic morphologies, ranging from compact arborizations to highly elaborate branching patterns. In vitro electrical recordings from these neurons have revealed a correspondingly diverse range of intrinsic firing patterns, including non-adapting, adapting and bursting types. This heterogeneity of electrical responsivity has generally been attributed to variability in the types and densities of ionic channels. We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

abstract = {In the present article, we provide a critical overview of the emerging field of 'neuroeducation' also frequently referred to as 'mind, brain and education' or 'educational neuroscience'. We describe the growing energy behind linking education and neuroscience in an effort to improve learning and instruction. We explore reasons behind such drives for interdisciplinary research. Reviewing some of the key advances in neuroscientific studies that have come to bear on neuroeducation, we discuss recent evidence on the brain circuits underlying reading, mathematical abilities as well as the potential to use neuroscience to design training programs of neurocognitive functions, such as working memory, that are expected to have effects on overall brain function. Throughout this review we describe how such research can enrich our understanding of the acquisition of academic skills. Furthermore, we discuss the potential for modern brain imaging methods to serve as diagnostic tools as well as measures of the effects of educational interventions. Throughout this discussion, we draw attention to limitations of the available evidence and propose future avenues for research. We also discuss the challenges that face this growing discipline. Specifically, we draw attention to unrealistic expectations for the immediate impact of neuroscience on education, methodological difficulties, and lack of interdisciplinary training, which results in poor communication between educators and neuroscientists. We point out that there should be bi-directional and reciprocal interactions between both disciplines of neuroscience and education, in which research originating from each of these traditions is considered to be compelling in its own right. While there are many obstacles that lie in the way of a productive field of neuroeducation, we contend that there is much reason to be optimistic and that the groundwork has been laid to advance this field in earnest. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

abstract = {Neuromorphic systems are designed to emulate certain structural and dynamical properties of biological neuronal networks, with the aim of inheriting the brain's functional performance and energy efficiency in artificial-intelligence applications [1, 2]. Among the platforms existing today, the spike-based BrainScaleS system stands out by realizing fast analog dynamics which can boost computationally expensive tasks [3]. Here we use the latest BrainScaleS generation [4] for the algorithm-free simulation of quantum systems, thereby opening up an entirely new application space for these devices. This requires an appropriate spike-based representation of quantum states and an associated training method for imprinting a desired target state onto the network. We employ a representation of quantum states using probability distributions [5, 6], enabling the use of a Bayesian sampling framework for spiking neurons [7]. For training, we developed a Hebbian learning scheme that explicitly exploits the inherent speed of the substrate, which enables us to realize a variety of network topologies. We encoded maximally entangled states of up to four qubits and observed fidelities that imply genuine N-partite entanglement. In particular, the encoding of entangled pure and mixed two-qubit states reaches a quality that allows the observation of Bell correlations, thus demonstrating that non-classical features of quantum systems can be captured by spiking neural dynamics. Our work establishes an intriguing connection between quantum systems and classical spiking networks, and demonstrates the feasibility of simulating quantum systems with neuromorphic hardware.},

abstract = {A spiking neuron "computes" by transforming a complex dynamical input into a train of action potentials, or spikes. The computation performed by the neuron can be formulated as dimensional reduction, or feature detection, followed by a nonlinear decision function over the low-dimensional space. Generalizations of the reverse correlation technique with white noise input provide a numerical strategy for extracting the relevant low-dimensional features from experimental data, and information theory can be used to evaluate the quality of the low-dimensional approximation. We apply these methods to analyze the simplest biophysically realistic model neuron, the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, using this system to illustrate the general methodological issues. We focus on the features in the stimulus that trigger a spike, explicitly eliminating the effects of interactions between spikes. One can approximate this triggering "feature space" as a two-dimensional linear subspace in the high-dimensional space of input histories, capturing in this way a substantial fraction of the mutual information between inputs and spike time. We find that an even better approximation, however, is to describe the relevant subspace as two dimensional but curved; in this way, we can capture 90% of the mutual information even at high time resolution. Our analysis provides a new understanding of the computational properties of the HH model. While it is common to approximate neural behavior as "integrate and fire," the HH model is not an integrator nor is it well described by a single threshold.},

abstract = {Recently, theorists have begun to speculate about the nature of passionate and companionate love. Evolutionary psychologists have tended to emphasize the pan‐cultural nature of passionate love. Historians have stressed the fact that, in different historical eras, people's attitudes toward love, sex, and intimacy have varied widely. Cross‐cultural researchers contend that, even today, societies differ greatly in their attitudes toward love. In this study, 124 men and 184 women from four ethnic backgrounds were asked if they were currently in love and how passionately and companionately in love they were. The four groups differed, as predicted, in their general orientations toward life. European‐Americans were the most individualistic, Japanese‐Americans and Pacific Islanders were intermediate in individualism/collectivism, and Chinese‐Americans were the most collectivist. Nonetheless, in the specific area of love, the various American ethnic groups did not differ significantly in the likelihood of being in love, nor in the intensity of the passionate love (PL) or companionate love (CL) they felt. In all ethnic groups, men's and women's adult attachment styles predicted romantic feelings and experiences. The anxious were the most likely to be in a love relationship, and they scored the highest on the PL scale; avoidants scored lowest. The secure scored the highest on the CL scale; avoidants scored the lowest. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

However, it has so far proved difficult to demonstrate their existence in vivo. Moreover, it is not clear whether NMDA spikes are relevant to the output of pyramidal neurons. We found that local NMDA spikes occurred in tuft dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons both spontaneously and following sensory input, and had a large influence on the number of output action potentials. Using two-photon activation of an intracellular caged NMDA receptor antagonist (tc-MK801), we found that isolated NMDA spikes typically occurred in multiple branches simultaneously and that sensory stimulation substantially increased their probability. Our results demonstrate that NMDA receptors have a vital role in coupling the tuft region of the layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron to the cell body, enhancing the effectiveness of layer 1 input. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract = {Computer simulation of neural matter is a promising methodology for understanding the function of the brain. Recent anatomical studies have mapped the intricate structure of cortex, and these data have been exploited in numerous simulations attempting to explain its function. However, the largest of these models run inconveniently slowly and require vast amounts of electrical power, which hinders useful experimentation. SpiNNaker is a novel computer architecture designed to address these problems using low-power microprocessors and custom communication hardware. We use four SpiNNaker chips (of a planned fifty thousand) to simulate, in real-time, a cortical circuit of ten thousand spiking neurons and four million synapses. In this simulation, the hardware consumes 100. nJ per neuron per millisecond and 43. nJ per postsynaptic potential, which is the smallest quantity reported for any digital computer. We argue that this approaches fast, power-feasible and scientifically useful simulations of large cortical areas. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

@article{Balaji2020,
abstract = {With growing model complexity, mapping Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming increasingly challenging. This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz. a crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of pre-synaptic connections per post-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many pre-synaptic connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in model quality, e.g., accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes a neuron function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation node, with two pre-synaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all pre-synaptic connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate an average 60% lower crossbar requirement, 9x higher synapse utilization, 62% lower wasted energy on the hardware, and between 0.8% and 4.6% increase in model quality.},

The cells were differentiated in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and neurons and counting were done in each of the four lobes. The study showed that the different subpopulations of glial cells behave differently as a function of age; the number of oligodendrocytes showed a significant 27% decrease over adult life and a strong correlation to the total number of neurons while the total astrocyte number is constant through life; finally males have a 28% higher number of neocortical glial cells and a 19% higher neocortical neuron number than females. The overall total number of neocortical neurons and glial cells was 49.3 billion in females and 65.2 billion in males, a difference of 24% with a high biological variance.

abstract = {Nearly 6 million people in the United States are currently living with paralysis in which 23% of the cases are related to spinal cord injury (SCI). Miniaturized closed-loop neural interfaces have the potential for restoring function and mobility lost to debilitating neural injuries such as SCI by leveraging recent advancements in bioelectronics and a better understanding of the processes that underlie functional and anatomical reorganization in an injured nervous system. This paper describes our current progress towards developing a miniaturized brain-machine-spinal cord interface (BMSI) that is envisioned to convert in real time the neural command signals recorded from the brain to electrical stimuli delivered to the spinal cord below the injury level. Specifically, the paper reports on a corticospinal interface integrated circuit (IC) as a core building block for such a BMSI that is capable of low-noise recording of extracellular neural spikes from the cerebral cortex as well as muscle activation using intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) in a rat with contusion injury to the thoracic spinal cord. The paper further presents results from a neurobiological study conducted in both normal and SCI rats to investigate the effect of various ISMS parameters on movement thresholds in the rat hindlimb. Coupled with proper signal-processing algorithms in the future for the transformation between the cortically recorded data and ISMS parameters, such a BMSI has the potential to facilitate functional recovery after an SCI by re-establishing corticospinal communication channels lost due to the injury.},

abstract = {Retinal electrostimulation is promising a successful therapy to restore functional vision. However, a narrow stimulating current range exists between retinal neuron excitation and inhibition which may lead to misperformance of visual prostheses. As the conveyance of representation of complex visual scenes may require neighbouring electrodes to be activated simultaneously, electric field summation may contribute to reach this inhibitory threshold. This study used three approaches to assess the implications of relatively high stimulating conditions in visual prostheses: (1) in vivo, using a suprachoroidal prosthesis implanted in a feline model, (2) in vitro through electrostimulation of murine retinal preparations, and (3) in silico by computing the response of a population of retinal ganglion cells. Inhibitory stimulating conditions led to diminished cortical activity in the cat. Stimulus-response relationships showed non-monotonic profiles to increasing stimulating current. This was observed in vitro and in silico as the combined response of groups of neurons (close to the stimulating electrode) being inhibited at certain stimulating amplitudes, whilst other groups (far from the stimulating electrode) being recruited. These findings may explain the halo-like phosphene shapes reported in clinical trials and suggest that simultaneous stimulation in retinal prostheses is limited by the inhibitory threshold of the retinal ganglion cells.},

abstract = {The electrical activity of a neuron is strongly dependent on the ionic channels present in its membrane. Modifying the maximal conductances from these channels can have a dramatic impact on neuron behavior. But the effect of such modifications can also be cancelled out by compensatory mechanisms among different channels. We used an evolution strategy with a fitness function based on phase-plane analysis to obtain 20 very different computational models of the cerebellar Purkinje cell. All these models produced very similar outputs to current injections, including tiny details of the complex firing pattern. These models were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models in this complex landscape. Unraveling the landscape is an important step towards the understanding of functional homeostasis of neurons},

abstract = {In the last years, the idea to dynamically interface biological neurons with artificial ones has become more and more urgent. The reason is essentially due to the design of innovative neuroprostheses where biological cell assemblies of the brain can be substituted by artificial ones. For closed-loop experiments with biological neuronal networks interfaced with in silico modeled networks, several technological challenges need to be faced, from the low-level interfacing between the living tissue and the computational model to the implementation of the latter in a suitable form for real-time processing. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can improve flexibility when simple neuronal models are required, obtaining good accuracy, real-time performance, and the possibility to create a hybrid system without any custom hardware, just programming the hardware to achieve the required functionality. In this paper, this possibility is explored presenting a modular and efficient FPGA design of an in silico spiking neural network exploiting the Izhikevich model. The proposed system, prototypically implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 6 device, is able to simulate a fully connected network counting up to 1,440 neurons, in real-time, at a sampling rate of 10 kHz, which is reasonable for small to medium scale extra-cellular closed-loop experiments.},

abstract = {Sleep is important for abstraction of the underlying principles (or gist) which bind together conceptually related stimuli, but little is known about the neural correlates of this process. Here, we investigate this issue using overnight sleep monitoring and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were exposed to a statistically structured sequence of auditory tones then tested immediately for recognition of short sequences which conformed to the learned statistical pattern. Subsequently, after consolidation over either 30 min or 24 h, they performed a delayed test session in which brain activity was monitored with fMRI. Behaviorally, there was greater improvement across 24 h than across 30 min, and this was predicted by the amount of slow wave sleep (SWS) obtained. Functionally, we observed weaker parahippocampal responses and stronger striatal responses after sleep. Like the behavioral result, these differences in functional response were predicted by the amount of SWS obtained. Furthermore, connectivity between stria-tum and parahippocampus was weaker after sleep, whereas connectivity between putamen and planum temporale was stronger. Taken together, these findings suggest that abstraction is associated with a gradual shift from the hippocampal to the striatal memory system and that this may be mediated by SWS. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.},

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the cellular mechanisms of STDP at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and of the associated changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic integration. Beyond the basic asymmetric window, recent studies have also revealed several layers of complexity in STDP, including its dependence on dendritic location, the nonlinear integration of synaptic modification induced by complex spike trains, and the modulation of STDP by inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs. Finally, the functional consequences of STDP have been examined directly in an increasing number of neural circuits in vivo.},

abstract = {The accurate simulation of a neuron's ability to integrate distributed synaptic input typically requires the simultaneous solution of tens of thousands of ordinary differential equations. For, in order to understand how a cell distinguishes between input patterns we apparently need a model that is biophysically accurate down to the space scale of a single spine, i.e., 1 $\mu$m. We argue here that one can retain this highly detailed input structure while dramatically reducing the overall system dimension if one is content to accurately reproduce the associated membrane potential at a small number of places, e.g., at the site of action potential initiation, under subthreshold stimulation. The latter hypothesis permits us to approximate the active cell model with an associated quasi-active model, which in turn we reduce by both time-domain (Balanced Truncation) and frequency-domain (H2 approximation of the transfer function) methods. We apply and contrast these methods on a suite of typical cells, achieving up to four orders of magnitude in dimension reduction and an associated speed-up in the simulation of dendritic democratization and resonance. We also append a threshold mechanism and indicate that this reduction has the potential to deliver an accurate quasi-integrate and fire model. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract = {Ideally detailed neuron models should make use of morphological and electrophysiological data from the same cell. However, this rarely happens. Typically a modeler will choose a cell morphology from a public database, assign standard values for Ra, Cm, and other parameters and then do the modeling study. The assumption is that the model will produce results representative of what might be obtained experimentally. To test this assumption we developed models of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons using 4 different morphologies obtained from 3 public databases. The multiple run fitter in NEURON was used to fit parameter values in each of the 4 morphological models to match experimental data recorded from 19 CA1 pyramidal cells. Fits with fixed standard parameter values produced results that were generally not representative of our experimental data. However, when parameter values were allowed to vary, excellent fits were obtained in almost all cases, but the fitted parameter values were very different among the 4 reconstructions and did not match standard values. The differences in fitted values can be explained by very different diameters, total lengths, membrane areas and volumes among the reconstructed cells, reflecting either cell heterogeneity or issues with the reconstruction data. The fitted values compensated for these differences to make the database cells and experimental cells more similar electrotonically. We conclude that models using fully reconstructed morphologies need to be calibrated with experimental data (even when morphological and electrophysiological data come from the same cell), model results should be generated with multiple reconstructions, morphological and experimental cells should come from the same strain of animal at the same age, and blind use of standard parameter values in models that use reconstruction data may not produce representative experimental results.},

The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin contribute to the processing of social cues necessary for individual recognition. Mesolimbic dopamine is involved in reinforcement and reward learning. Concurrent activation of neuropeptide and dopamine receptors in the reward centers of the brain during mating results in a conditioned partner preference, observed as a pair bond.

Its expansion has become possible due to both technological and clinical advances in pain medicine. The first implantable systems were surgically placed. However, it is currently commonplace to use percutaneous leads, as this approach has become instrumental in its expansion. The first percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulators were reported in 1999. Cylindrical leads were implanted to stimulate the greater occipital nerve to manage intractable headache. It has been expanded into other individual nerves or nerve plexuses to treat neuropathic, visceral, cardiac, abdominal, low back and facial pain. The use of PNS in modulating organ function in treatment of syndromes such as epilepsy, incontinence and obesity with vagal, tibial and gastric stimulation is under extensive investigation. New technologies that allow easier and safer electrode placement are expected to further expand the uses of PNS.

Generating neuromorphic action potentials in a circuit element theoretically requires a minimum of third-order complexity (for example, three dynamical electrophysical processes)5, but there have been few examples of second-order neuromorphic elements, and no previous demonstration of any isolated third-order element6–8. Using both experiments and modelling, here we show how multiple electrophysical processes—including Mott transition dynamics—form a nanoscale third-order circuit element. We demonstrate simple transistorless networks of third-order elements that perform Boolean operations and find analogue solutions to a computationally hard graph-partitioning problem. This work paves a way towards very compact and densely functional neuromorphic computing primitives, and energy-efficient validation of neuroscientific models.},

abstract = {Input conductance and axonal conduction velocity were measured for hindlimb motoneurones that were anatomically labelled by substances injected through the intracellular microelectrode (Procion dyes, horseradish peroxidase). We confirmed that there is a good correlation between the axonal conduction velocity of a hindlimb motoneurone and the size of its cell body. Furthermore, we confirmed that the power relation between neuronal input conductance and axonal conduction velocity has an exponent of about 3-4. If large motoneurones were simply scaled-up versions of the smaller ones, this exponent should be have been between 1.5 and 2.0. We showed that the unexpectedly high input conductance of fast-axoned motoneurones, compared to that of the more slow-axoned ones, was not due to a corresponding disproportion between the axonal conduction velocity and the size of the cell body. Neither could it be explained by differences between large and small cells with respect to the relative sizes and numbers of dendritic stems. The unexpectedly high input conductance of large cells seems likely to be largely caused by a lower average value for the specific membrane resistance among these cells than among the smaller ones. Hitherto unknown differences in dendritic architecture between large and smaller cells might conceivably be of some importance as well. Our results are consistent with the view that, in muscle contractions evoked by the central nervous system, thin-axoned motoneurones might be recruited more easily than more thick-axoned ones even if all the cells were activated by the same density of equipotent synapses. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

These studies require models of individual neurons with realistic input-output properties. Recently, it was found that spiking models can accurately predict the precisely timed spike trains produced by cortical neurons in response to somatically injected currents, if properly fitted. This requires fitting techniques that are efficient and flexible enough to easily test different candidate models. We present a generic solution, based on the Brian simulator (a neural network simulator in Python), which allows the user to define and fit arbitrary neuron models to electrophysiological recordings. It relies on vectorization and parallel computing techniques to achieve efficiency. We demonstrate its use on neural recordings in the barrel cortex and in the auditory brainstem, and confirm that simple adaptive spiking models can accurately predict the response of cortical neurons. Finally, we show how a complex multicompartmental model can be reduced to a simple effective spiking model.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we compare different representations for modeling voltage-dependent currents and delineate some of the differences between these representations. In the case of sodium channels, models of increasing complexity, from simplified two-state representations to multistate Markov diagrams, can capture some of the features of sodium channels and of action potentials. Which model to chose depends on the type of experimental data available and its level of precision. It is clear that a two-state scheme cannot capture the features of single-channel recordings, which require Markov models of sufficient complexity to account for the data. On the other hand, we show that even simplified two- or three-state representations can capture phenomena such as action potentials. If the principal requirement is to generate action potentials, it is therefore not necessary to include all the complexity of the most sophisticated Markov diagrams of channels and simplified representations appears sufficient. This simplistic approach may be adequate for models involving large-scale networks of thousands of cells, for which computational efficiency is a more important concern than reproducing all the microscopic features of the channels. In the case of the T-current, we show that various formalisms, such as empirical Hodgkin-Huxley type models, thermodynamic models and Markov models, can capture the behavior of the T-current in voltage-clamp and generate low-threshold spikes. In this case, Markov models are probably more accurate because they also account for single-channel recordings, while Hodgkin-Huxley type models do not. The voltage-clamp data shown here were obtained in thalamic neurons and, for the particular case of these data, they were best modeled by a Hodgkin-Huxley type model in which rate constants were fit to experimental data using empirical functions of voltage. The best physically-plausible approach to capture these data is to use templates taken from nonlinear thermodynamic models, which provide a fitting of comparable quality to empirical functions. We therefore conclude that nonlinear thermodynamic models should be used to yield representations that are consistent with experimental data while having a plausible biophysical interpretation.},

However, the role of MEL's metabolites, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), in these effects are unknown. The current study directly investigated the acute effects of systemic MEL, AFMK, and AMK on novel object recognition. We also analyzed MEL, AFMK, and AMK levels in hippocampus and temporal lobe containing the perirhinal cortex following systemic MEL and AMK treatment. AMK administered post-training had a more potent effect on object memory than MEL and AFMK. AMK was also able to rescue age-associated declines in memory impairments when object memory was tested up to 4 days following training. Results from administering AMK at varying times around the training trial and the metabolism time course in brain tissue suggest that AMK's memory-enhancing effects reflect memory consolidation. Furthermore, inhibiting the MEL-to-AMK metabolic pathway disrupted object memory at 24 hours post-training, suggesting that endogenous AMK might play an important role in long-term memory formation. This is the first study to report that AMK facilitates long-term object memory performance in mice, and that MEL crosses the blood-brain barrier and is immediately converted to AMK in brain tissue. Overall, these results support AMK as a potential therapeutic agent to improve or prevent memory decline.},

abstract = {Objective. A common approach in modelling extracellular electrical stimulation is to represent neural tissue by a volume conductor when calculating the activating function as the driving term in a cable equation for the membrane potential. This approach ignores the cellular composition of tissue, including the neurites and their combined effect on the extracellular potential. This has a number of undesirable consequences. First, the two natural and equally valid choices of boundary conditions for the cable equation (i.e. using either voltage or current) lead to two mutually inconsistent predictions of the membrane potential. Second, the spatio-temporal distribution of the extracellular potential can be strongly affected by the combined cellular composition of the tissue. In this paper, we develop a mean field volume conductor theory to overcome these shortcomings of available models.
Approach. This method connects the microscopic properties of the constituent fibres to the macroscopic electrical properties of the tissue by introducing an admittivity kernel for the neural tissue that is non-local, non-instantaneous and anisotropic. This generalizes the usual tissue conductivity. A class of bidomain models that is mathematically equivalent to this class of self-consistent volume conductor models is also presented. The bidomain models are computationally convenient for simulating the activation map of neural tissue using numerical methods such as finite element analysis.
Main results. The theory is first developed for tissue composed of identical, parallel fibres and then extended to general neural tissues composed of mixtures of neurites with different and arbitrary orientations, arrangements and properties. Equations describing the extracellular and membrane potential for the longitudinal and transverse modes of stimulation are derived.
Significance. The theory complements our earlier work, which developed extensions to cable theory for the micro-scale equations of neural stimulation that apply to individual fibres. The modelling framework provides a number of advantages over other approaches currently adopted in the literature and, therefore, can be used to accurately estimate the membrane potential generated by extracellular electrical stimulation.},

abstract = {Neurons process and encode information by generating sequences of action potentials. For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding. Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials--their rapid initiation and variable onset potential--are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.},

abstract = {On the basis of task-related imaging studies in normal human subjects, it has been suggested that two attention systems exist in the human brain: a bilateral dorsal attention system involved in top-down orienting of attention and a right-lateralized ventral attention system involved in reorienting attention in response to salient sensory stimuli. An important question is whether this functional organization emerges only in response to external attentional demands or is represented more fundamentally in the internal dynamics of brain activity. To address this question, we examine correlations in spontaneous fluctuations of the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit attentional demands. We identify a bilateral dorsal attention system and a right-lateralized ventral attention system solely on the basis of spontaneous activity. Further, we observe regions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with both systems, a potential mechanism for mediating the functional interaction between systems. These findings demonstrate that the neuroanatomical substrates of human attention persist in the absence of external events, reflected in the correlation structure of spontaneous activity. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The computational power of the neocortex arises from interactions of multiple neurons, which display a wide range of electrical properties. The gene expression profiles underlying this phenotypic diversity are unknown. To explore this relationship, we combined whole-cell electrical recordings with single-cell multiplex RT-PCR of rat (p13-16) neocortical neurons to obtain cDNA libraries of 26 ion channels (including voltage activated potassium channels, Kv1.1/2/4/6, Kvbeta1/2, Kv2.1/2, Kv3.1/2/3/4, Kv4.2/3; sodium/potassium permeable hyperpolarization activated channels, HCN1/2/3/4; the calcium activated potassium channel, SK2; voltage activated calcium channels, Caalpha1A/B/G/I, Cabeta1/3/4), three calcium binding proteins (calbindin, parvalbumin and calretinin) and GAPDH. We found a previously unreported clustering of ion channel genes around the three calcium-binding proteins. We further determined that cells similar in their expression patterns were also similar in their electrical properties. Subsequent regression modeling with statistical resampling yielded a set of coefficients that reliably predicted electrical properties from the expression profile of individual neurons. This is the first report of a consistent relationship between the co-expression of a large profile of ion channel and calcium binding protein genes and the electrical phenotype of individual neocortical neurons.},

@article{Izhikevich2003a,
abstract = {What is the functional significance of generating a burst of spikes, as opposed to a single spike? A dominant point of view is that bursts are needed to increase the reliability of communication between neurons. Here, we discuss the alternative, but complementary, hypothesis: bursts with specific resonant interspike frequencies are more likely to cause a postsynaptic cell to fire than are bursts with higher or lower frequencies. Such a frequency preference might occur at the level of individual synapses because of the interplay between short-term synaptic depression and facilitation, or at the postsynaptic cell level because of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations and resonance. As a result, the same burst could resonate for some synapses or cells and not resonate for others, depending on their natural resonance frequencies. This observation suggests that, in addition to increasing reliability of synaptic transmission, bursts of action potentials might provide effective mechanisms for selective communication between neurons.},

abstract = {We investigate the heterogeneity of electrical conductivity as a new mechanism to stimulate excitable tissues via applied electric fields. In particular, we show that stimulation of axons crossing internal boundaries can occur at boundaries where the electric conductivity of the volume conductor changes abruptly. The effectiveness of this and other stimulation mechanisms was compared by means of models and computer simulations in the context of transcranial magnetic stimulation. While, for a given stimulation intensity, the largest membrane depolarization occurred where an axon terminates or bends sharply in a high electric field region, a slightly smaller membrane depolarization, still sufficient to generate action potentials, also occurred at an internal boundary where the conductivity jumped from 0.143 S m-1 to 0.333 S m-1, simulating a white-matter-grey-matter interface. Tissue heterogeneity can also give rise to local electric field gradients that are considerably stronger and more focal than those impressed by the stimulation coil and that can affect the membrane potential, albeit to a lesser extent than the two mechanisms mentioned above. Tissue heterogeneity may play an important role in electric and magnetic 'far-field' stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Williams1988,
abstract = {In comparing strategies used to control neuron number, we find it useful to view nervous system development as occurring in three phases. The phases overlap--each is a process, not an event. The first phase is the development of a genetic nervous system. This is a nervous system of simple genetic intention, not a blueprint or pile of bricks. Its characteristics are abstract: How many neurons in this stem cell destined to produce, which cells are programmed to die, how much target does this cell need to survive. At the level of the individual, the genetic nervous system is essentially fixed, but over generations it is fluid. As this genetic intent interacts within a world of cells, a real brain appears. A new set of rules only tacitly present in the genome is expressed--the embryonic nervous system emerges. The interaction of its parts defines the shape and size of the nervous system. Neuron numbers are adjusted interactively by changes in proliferative potential and the severity of cell death. Cell fates are established in part through interactions with other cells and with hormones. Glial cell numbers are adjusted to match the neuron populations. This phase of brain development is what the embryologist sees under the microscope. The third and final phase of development begins when the brain starts to function and the animal starts to deal with its world. Small changes in neuron number may occur during this period, but these changes are generally of minor functional importance. At this point, the smaller elements of neuronal organization are refined in shape, number, and distribution. Axons are lost or rearranged; dendrites grow, branch, and retract; synapses are fine-tuned; and finally, receptor densities and transmitter titres are adjusted. Some of these interactions and numerical adjustments continue until the animal dies.},

Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo ("particle filtering") methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximization. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise.},

Dendrites have the pivotal role in collecting the signals from other neurons and transmitting them to soma which implies that the dendrites act as an input device to the neuron. Soma performs a Non-linear operation, i.e. if input exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is generated. The Axon performs the role of an output device which takes the processed signal from soma and transmitting it to the other neurons. This is the basic function of a biological neuron. A biological neuron model which is also known as Spiking Neuron Model is a mathematical description of properties of neuron that is to be designed accurately to describe and predict the biological processes.

This mini review is intended for a general engineering audience not currently familiar with this exciting research area. It provides descriptions of some of the recent advances, including supercomputer and single-device implementations, approaches based on spiking and nonspiking neurons, machine learning hardware accelerators, and those utilizing memristive devices.

While their size represents a decisive advantage in terms of integration density, it also raises the critical question of how to efficiently address large numbers of densely integrated nanodevices without the need for complex multi-layer interconnection topologies similar to those used in CMOS technology. Two-terminal programmable devices in crossbar geometry seem particularly attractive, but suffer from severe addressing difficulties due to cross-talk, which implies complex programming procedures. Three-terminal devices can be easily addressed individually, but with limited gain in terms of interconnect integration. We show how optically gated carbon nanotube devices enable efficient individual addressing when arranged in a crossbar geometry with shared gate electrodes. This topology is particularly well suited for parallel programming or learning in the context of neuromorphic computing architectures. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Computational modeling is being used increasingly in neuroscience. In deriving such models, inference issues such as model selection, model complexity, and model comparison must be addressed constantly. In this article we present briefly the Bayesian approach to inference. Under a simple set of commonsense axioms, there exists essentially a unique way of reasoning under uncertainty by assigning a degree of confidence to any hypothesis or model, given the available data and prior information. Such degrees of confidence must obey all the rules governing probabilities and can be updated accordingly as more data becomes available. While the Bayesian methodology can be applied to any type of model, as an example we outline its use for an important, and increasingly standard, class of models in computational neuroscience--compartmental models of single neurons. Inference issues are particularly relevant for these models: their parameter spaces are typically very large, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data are still sparse, and probabilistic aspects are often ignored. As a tutorial, we demonstrate the Bayesian approach on a class of one-compartment models with varying numbers of conductances. We then apply Bayesian methods on a compartmental model of a real neuron to determine the optimal amount of noise to add to the model to give it a level of spike time variability comparable to that found in the real cell.},

The device was fabricated using a standard 0.18$\mu$m CMOS technology node and has a total area of 99mm$^{2}$. We demonstrate its application to HFO detection in the iEEG recorded from 9 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery. The total average power consumption of the chip during the detection task was 614.3$\mu$W. We show how the neuromorphic system can reliably detect HFOs: the system predicts postsurgical seizure outcome with state-of-the-art accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (78%, 100%, and 33% respectively). This is the first feasibility study towards identifying relevant features in intracranial human data in real-time, on-chip, using event-based processors and spiking neural networks. By providing "neuromorphic intelligence" to neural recording circuits the approach proposed will pave the way for the development of systems that can detect HFO areas directly in the operation room and improve the seizure outcome of epilepsy surgery.},

abstract = {Love is one of the most desired experiences. The quest for understanding human bonds, especially love, was traditionally a domain of the humanities. Recent developments in biological sciences yield new insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of human relationships. Animal models of reproductive behaviors, mother-infant attachment and pair bonding complemented by human studies reveal neuroendocrine foundations of prosocial behaviors and emotions. Amongst various identified neurotransmitters and modulators, which control affiliative behaviors, the particular role of nanopeptides has been indicated. New studies suggest that these chemicals are not only involved in regulating bonding processes in animals but also contribute to generating positive social attitudes and feelings in humans. {\textcopyright} 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {The selective permeability of neuronal membranes to ions is the basis of various processes central to neurophysiology, such as the maintenance of a membrane potential, the genesis of neuronal excitability and the action of neurotransmitters and modulators. The rules governing ionic permeabilities were explored by Hodgkin, Huxley, Katz, and others several decades ago. It was demonstrated that the ionic permeability of the membrane can be highly dependent on the membrane potential. Hodgkin and Huxley 1 characterized these properties of voltage dependence and provided a mathematical model which proved that these properties were sufficient to account for the genesis of action potentials. The model of Hodgkin and Huxley was based on simple assumptions, reproduced well the behavior of the currents, and its parameters are easy to determine from experimental data. This explains why Hodgkin-Huxley models are still widely used today, almost 50 years later.},

abstract = {Neurons in cerebral cortical circuits interact by sending and receiving electrical impulses called spikes. The ongoing spiking activity of cortical circuits is fundamental to many cognitive functions including sensory processing, working memory, and decision making. London et al. [Sensitivity to Perturbations In Vivo Implies High Noise and Suggests Rate Coding in Cortex, Nature (London) 466, 123 (2010).] recently argued that even a single additional spike can cause a cascade of extra spikes that rapidly decorrelate the microstate of the network. Here, we show theoretically in a minimal model of cortical neuronal circuits that single-spike perturbations trigger only a very weak rate response. Nevertheless, single-spike perturbations are found to rapidly decorrelate the microstate of the network, although the dynamics is stable with respect to small perturbations. The coexistence of stable and unstable dynamics results from a system of exponentially separating dynamic flux tubes around stable trajectories in the network's phase space. The radius of these flux tubes appears to decrease algebraically with neuron number N and connectivity K, which implies that the entropy of the circuit's repertoire of state sequences scales as N ln(KN).},

abstract = {Anatomic and physiologic data are used to analyze the energy expenditure on different components of excitatory signaling in the grey matter of rodent brain. Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47% and 34%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13%), and glutamate recycling using only 3%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate - an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with ≤15% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation.},

abstract = {Hyperparameters and learning algorithms for neuromorphic hardware are usually chosen by hand to suit a particular task. In contrast, networks of neurons in the brain were optimized through extensive evolutionary and developmental processes to work well on a range of computing and learning tasks. Occasionally this process has been emulated through genetic algorithms, but these require themselves hand-design of their details and tend to provide a limited range of improvements. We employ instead other powerful gradient-free optimization tools, such as cross-entropy methods and evolutionary strategies, in order to port the function of biological optimization processes to neuromorphic hardware. As an example, we show these optimization algorithms enable neuromorphic agents to learn very efficiently from rewards. In particular, meta-plasticity, i.e., the optimization of the learning rule which they use, substantially enhances reward-based learning capability of the hardware. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time Learning-to-Learn benefits from such hardware, in particular, the capability to extract abstract knowledge from prior learning experiences that speeds up the learning of new but related tasks. Learning-to-Learn is especially suited for accelerated neuromorphic hardware, since it makes it feasible to carry out the required very large number of network computations.},

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These fi ndings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain},

Neuromorphic engineering attempts to take advantage of the efficiency of the brain by mimicking several crucial concepts to efficiently emulate AI tasks. Organic electronic materials have been particularly successful in mimicking both the basic functionality of the brain, including important spiking phenomena, but also in low-power operation of hardware-implemented artificial neural networks as well as interfacing with physiological environments due to their biocompatible nature. This article provides an overview of the basic functional operation of the brain and its artificial counterparts, with a particular focus on organic materials and devices. We highlight efforts to mimic brain functions such as spatiotemporal processing, homeostasis, and functional connectivity and emphasize current challenges for efficient neuromorphic computing applications. Finally, we present our view of future directions in this exciting and rapidly growing field of organic neuromorphic devices.},

abstract = {Background. A neuroprosthesis (NP) is a medical device that compensates and restores functionality of neural dysfunctions affected by different pathologies and conditions. To this end, an implantable NP (INP) must monitor and electrically stimulate neuronal small structures in the peripheral and central nervous system. Therefore, one of the most important parts of INPs are the sensors and electrodes since their size, resolution, and material are key for their design and performance. Currently, most of the studies focus only on the INP application but do not show the technical considerations of the sensors. Objective. This paper is a systematic literature review that summarizes and synthesizes implantable micro- and nanosensors/electrodes used in INPs for sensing and stimulating tissues. Data Sources. Articles and patents published in English were searched from electronic databases. No restrictions were made in terms of country or journal. Study Selection. All reports related to sensors/electrodes applied in INPs were included, focusing on micro- and nanotechnologies. Main Outcome Measures. Performance and potential profit. Results. There was a total of 153 selected articles from the 2010 to June 2020 period, of which 16 were about cardiac pacemakers, 15 cochlear implants, 13 retinal prosthesis, 31 deep brain stimulation, 6 bladder implants, and 18 implantable motor NPs. All those INPs are used for support or recovery of neural functions for hearing, seeing, pacing, and motor control, as well as bladder and bowel control. Micro- and nanosensors for signal stimulation and recording have four special requirements to meet: biocompatibility, long-term reliability, high selectivity, and low-energy consumption. Current and future considerations in sensor/electrode design should focus on improving efficiency and safety. This review is a first approximation for those who work on INP design; it offers an idea of the complexity on the matter and can guide them to specific references on the subject.},

Paired-cell recordings showed that inhibitory neurons of the same type were strongly interconnected by electrical synapses, but electrical synapses between different inhibitory cell types were rare. The electrical synapses were strong enough to synchronize spikes in coupled interneurons. Inhibitory chemical synapses were also common between FS cells, and between FS and LTS cells, but LTS cells rarely inhibited one another. Thalamocortical synapses, which convey sensory information to the cortex, specifically and strongly excited only the FS cell network. The electrical and chemical synaptic connections of different types of inhibitory neurons are specific, and may allow each inhibitory network to function independently.},

Here we ask the question: "What fraction of the volume should be taken up by axons and dendrites (i.e., wire) when these variables are at their optimal values?" The biophysical properties of axons and dendrites dictate that wire should occupy 3/5 of the volume in an optimally wired gray matter. We have measured the fraction of the volume occupied by each cellular component and find that the volume of wire is close to the predicted optimal value.},

The central implementation challenge is H-H model complexity that puts limits on the network size and on the execution speed. However, basics of the original model cannot be compromised when effect of synaptic specifications on the network behavior is the subject of study. To solve the problem, we used computational techniques such as CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm and step-by-step integration in the implementation of arithmetic circuits. In addition, we employed different techniques such as sharing resources to preserve the details of model as well as increasing the network size in addition to keeping the network execution speed close to real time while having high precision. Implementation of a two mini-columns network with 120/30 excitatory/inhibitory neurons is provided to investigate the characteristic of our method in practice. The implementation techniques provide an opportunity to construct large FPGA-based network models to investigate the effect of different neurophysiological mechanisms, like voltage-gated channels and synaptic activities, on the behavior of a neural network in an appropriate execution time. Additional to inherent properties of FPGA, like parallelism and re-configurability, our approach makes the FPGA-based system a proper candidate for study on neural control of cognitive robots and systems as well.},

This paper analyzes the neuromorphic systems Neurogrid, Braindrop, SpiNNaker, BrainScaleS, TrueNorth, Loihi, Darwin, and Dynap-SEL; and discusses the design of large scale spiking communication networks used in such systems. In particular, this paper looks at how each of these systems solved the challenges of forming packets with spiking information and how these packets are routed within the system. The routing of packets is analyzed at two scales: How the packets should be routed when traveling a short distance, and how the packets should be routed over longer global connections. Additional topics, such as the use of asynchronous circuits, robustness in communication, connection with a host machine, and network synchronization are also covered.},

abstract = {$\theta$ Frequency oscillation of the septo-hippocampal system has been considered as a prominent activity associated with cognitive function and affective processes. It is well documented that anxiolytic drugs diminish septo-hippocampal oscillatory $\theta$ activity contributing to their either therapeutic or unwanted side effects. In the present experiments we applied a combination of computational and physiological techniques to explore the functional role of GABAA receptors in $\theta$ oscillation. In electrophysiological experiments extracellular single unit recordings were performed from medial septum/diagonal band of Broca with simultaneous hippocampal (CA1) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from anesthetized rats. Neurotransmission at GABAA receptors were modulated by means of pharmacological tools: the actions of the GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator diazepam and inverse agonist/negative allosteric modulator FG-7142 were evaluated on septo-hippocampal activity. Systemic administration of diazepam inhibited, whereas FG-7142 enhanced $\theta$ oscillation of septal neurons and hippocampal EEG $\theta$ activity. In parallel to these experimental observations, a computational model has been constructed by implementing a septal GABA neuron model with a CA1 hippocampal model containing three types of neurons (including oriens and basket interneurons and pyramidal cells; latter modeled by multicompartmental techniques; for detailed model description with network parameters see online addendum: http://geza.kzoo.edu/theta). This connectivity made the network capable of simulating the responses of the septo-hippocampal circuitry to the modulation of GABAA transmission, and the presently described computational model proved suitable to reveal several aspects of pharmacological modulation of GABAA receptors. In addition, computational findings indicated different roles of distinctively located GABAA receptors in $\theta$ generation. {\textcopyright} 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

First, neuromorphic systems must perform memorizing and processing functions, using same elements. Second, it must allow data acquisition from sensors with preliminary processing and recording. Third, it must allow non-equilibrium processes, such as oscillator behavior at fixed values of input stimuli. Fourth, it must mimic some features of nervous systems. Fifth, it must permit possibility of coupling with living beings. In this paper, these features are considered with a special attention to how memristive devices can be implemented for reaching the goal. Comparison of characteristic properties of organic and inorganic memristive devices is discussed.},

abstract = {Normal eating behaviour is coordinated by the tightly regulated balance between intestinal and extra-intestinal homeostatic and hedonic mechanisms. By contrast, food addiction is a complex, maladaptive eating behaviour that reflects alterations in brain–gut–microbiome (BGM) interactions and a shift of this balance towards hedonic mechanisms. Each component of the BGM axis has been implicated in the development of food addiction, with both brain to gut and gut to brain signalling playing a role. Early-life influences can prime the infant gut microbiome and brain for food addiction, which might be further reinforced by increased antibiotic usage and dietary patterns throughout adulthood. The ubiquitous availability and marketing of inexpensive, highly palatable and calorie-dense food can further shift this balance towards hedonic eating through both central (disruptions in dopaminergic signalling) and intestinal (vagal afferent function, metabolic endotoxaemia, systemic immune activation, changes to gut microbiome and metabolome) mechanisms. In this Review, we propose a systems biology model of BGM interactions, which incorporates published reports on food addiction, and provides novel insights into treatment targets aimed at each level of the BGM axis.},

abstract = {Although the gastrointestinal (GI) tract possesses intrinsic neural plexuses that allow a significant degree of autonomy over GI functions, the central nervous system (CNS) provides extrinsic neural inputs that regulate, modulate, and control these functions. While the intestines are capable of functioning in the absence of extrinsic inputs, the stomach and esophagus are much more dependent upon extrinsic neural inputs, particularly from parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways. The sympathetic nervous system exerts a predominantly inhibitory effect upon GI muscle and provides a tonic inhibitory influence over mucosal secretion while, at the same time, regulates GI blood flow via neurally mediated vasoconstriction. The parasympathetic nervous system, in contrast, exerts both excitatory and inhibitory control over gastric and intestinal tone and motility. Although GI functions are controlled by the autonomic nervous system and occur, by and large, independently of conscious perception, it is clear that the higher CNS centers influence homeostatic control as well as cognitive and behavioral functions. This review will describe the basic neural circuitry of extrinsic inputs to the GI tract as well as the major CNS nuclei that innervate and modulate the activity of these pathways. The role of CNS-centered reflexes in the regulation of GI functions will be discussed as will modulation of these reflexes under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Finally, future directions within the field will be discussed in terms of important questions that remain to be resolved and advances in technology that may help provide these answers.},

abstract = {Many molecular, physiological and behavioural processes display distinct 24-hour rhythms that are directed by the circadian system. The master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus region of the hypothalamus, is synchronized or entrained by the light–dark cycle and, in turn, synchronizes clocks present in peripheral tissues and organs. Other environmental cues, most importantly feeding time, also synchronize peripheral clocks. In this way, the circadian system can prepare the body for predictable environmental changes such as the availability of nutrients during the normal feeding period. This Review summarizes existing knowledge about the diurnal regulation of gastrointestinal processes by circadian clocks present in the digestive tract and its accessory organs. The circadian control of gastrointestinal digestion, motility, hormones and barrier function as well as of the gut microbiota are discussed. An overview is given of the interplay between different circadian clocks in the digestive system that regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid and bile acid metabolism. Additionally, the bidirectional interaction between the master clock and peripheral clocks in the digestive system, encompassing different entraining factors, is described. Finally, the possible behavioural adjustments or pharmacological strategies for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of chronodisruption are outlined.},

abstract = {Nocturnal dreams can be considered as a kind of simulation of the real world on a higher cognitive level. Within lucid dreams, the dreamer is able to control the ongoing dream content and is free to do what he or she wants. In this pilot study, the possibility of practicing a simple motor task in a lucid dream was studied. Forty participants were assigned to a lucid dream practice group, a physical practice group and a control group. The motor task was to toss 10-cent coins into a cup and hit as many as possible out of 20 tosses. Waking performance was measured in the evening and on the next morning by the participants at home. The 20 volunteers in the lucid dream practice group attempted to carry out the motor task in a lucid dream on a single night. Seven participants succeeded in having a lucid dream and practiced the experimental task. This group of seven showed a significant improvement in performance (from 3.7 to 5.3); the other 13 subjects showed no improvement (from 3.4 to 2.9). Comparing all four groups, the physical practice group demonstrated the highest enhancement in performance followed by the successful lucid dream practice group. Both groups had statistically significant higher improvements in contrast to the nondreaming group and the control group. Even though the experimental design is not able to explain if specific effects (motor learning) or unspecific effects (motivation) caused the improvement, the results of this study showed that rehearsing in a lucid dream enhances subsequent performance in wakefulness. To clarify the factors which increased performance after lucid dream practice and to control for confounding factors, it is suggested that sleep laboratory studies should be conducted in the future. The possibilities of lucid dream practice for professional sports will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {How sleep helps learning and memory remains unknown. We report in mouse motor cortex that sleep after motor learning promotes the formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on a subset of branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons. New spines are formed on different sets of dendritic branches in response to different learning tasks and are protected from being eliminated when multiple tasks are learned. Neurons activated during learning of a motor task are reactivated during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, and disrupting this neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation. These findings indicate that sleep has a key role in promoting learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance on selected dendritic branches, which contribute to memory storage.},

abstract = {The conservation of sleep across all animal species suggests that sleep serves a vital function. We here report that sleep has a critical function in ensuring metabolic homeostasis. Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion and two-photon imaging in live mice, we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are associated with a 60% increase in the interstitial space, resulting in a striking increase in convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. In turn, convective fluxes of interstitial fluid increased the rate of $\beta$-amyloid clearance during sleep. Thus, the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system.},

abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a period of high risk for the onset of depression, characterized by variability in symptoms, severity, and course. During adolescence, the neurocircuitry implicated in depression continues to mature, suggesting that it is an important period for intervention. Reflecting the recent emergence of ‘precision mental health' – a person-centered approach to identifying, preventing, and treating psychopathology – researchers have begun to document associations between heterogeneity in features of depression and individual differences in brain circuitry, most frequently in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Methods: In this review, we present emerging work examining pre- and post-treatment measures of network connectivity in depressed adolescents; these studies reveal potential intervention-specific neural markers of treatment efficacy. We also review findings from studies examining associations between network connectivity and both types of depressive symptoms and response to treatment in adults, and indicate how this work can be extended to depressed adolescents. Finally, we offer recommendations for research that we believe will advance the science of precision mental health of adolescence. Results: Nascent studies suggest that linking RSFC-based pathophysiological variation with effects of different types of treatment and changes in mood following specific interventions will strengthen predictions of prognosis and treatment response. Studies with larger sample sizes and direct comparisons of treatments are required to determine whether RSFC patterns are reliable neuromarkers of treatment response for depressed adolescents. Although we are not yet at the point of using RSFC to guide clinical decision-making, findings from research examining the stability and reliability of RSFC point to a favorable future for network-based clinical phenotyping. Conclusions: Delineating the correspondence between specific clinical characteristics of depression (e.g., symptoms, severity, and treatment response) and patterns of network-based connectivity will facilitate the development of more tailored and effective approaches to the assessment, prevention, and treatment of depression in adolescents.},

abstract = {Neural circuits are regulated by activity-dependent feedback systems that tightly control network excitability and which are thought to be crucial for proper brain development. Defects in the ability to establish and maintain network homeostasis may be central to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine the function of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-mTOR signaling pathway, a common target of mutations associated with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder, in regulating activity-dependent processes in the mouse hippocampus. We find that the TSC-mTOR pathway is a central component of a positive feedback loop that promotes network activity by repressing inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons. In Tsc1 KO neurons, weakened inhibition caused by deregulated mTOR alters the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, leading to hippocampal hyperexcitability. These findings identify the TSC-mTOR pathway as a regulator of neural network activity and have implications for the neurological dysfunction in disorders exhibiting deregulated mTOR signaling},
