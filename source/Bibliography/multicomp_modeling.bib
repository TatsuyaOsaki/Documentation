abstract = {[A widely accepted model of nerve conduction is based on nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) derived for the giant axon of the squid Loligo by Hodgkin and Huxley. When considered as part of a particular initial-boundary value problem (IBVP), these equations model the electrical activity of an axon under conditions found both in nature and in the laboratory. The backward Euler method for this nonlinear system is presented, and a functional iteration algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear difference equations encountered at each timestep is proposed. Convergence of this iterative algorithm in the L∞ norm is established, along with the dependence of this convergence on discretization parameters. This provides existence and uniqueness of the solution to the nonlinear difference equations. It is then proven that the numerical method provides a solution that converges to the solution of the differential equations with formal order of accuracy O($\Delta$ t) + O(($\Delta$ x)2) in the L∞ norm. Finally, a priori L∞ bounds on the backward Euler solution are derived. These bounds provide necessary control essential to the previous results.]},

@article{Cooley1966,
abstract = {The Hodgkin-Huxley model of the nerve axon describes excitation and propagation of the nerve impulse by means of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This equation relates the conservation of the electric current along the cablelike structure of the axon to the active processes represented by a system of three rate equations for the transport of ions through the nerve membrane. These equations have been integrated numerically with respect to both distance and time for boundary conditions corresponding to a finite length of squid axon stimulated intracellularly at its midpoint. Computations were made for the threshold strength-duration curve and for the repetitive firing of propagated impulses in response to a maintained stimulus. These results are compared with previous solutions for the space-clamped axon. The effect of temperature on the threshold intensity for a short stimulus and for rheobase was determined for a series of values of temperature. Other computations show that a highly unstable subthreshold propagating wave is initiated in principle by a just threshold stimulus; that the stability of the subthreshold wave can be enhanced by reducing the excitability of the axon as with an anesthetic agent, perhaps to the point where it might be observed experimentally; but that with a somewhat greater degree of narcotization, the axon gives only decrementally propagated impulses.},

@article{Maki-Marttunen2018,
abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Recent progress in electrophysiological and optical methods for neuronal recordings provides vast amounts of high-resolution data. In parallel, the development of computer technology has allowed simulation of ever-larger neuronal circuits. A challenge in taking advantage of these developments is the construction of single-cell and network models in a way that faithfully reproduces neuronal biophysics with subcellular level of details while keeping the simulation costs at an acceptable level.<h4>New method</h4>In this work, we develop and apply an automated, stepwise method for fitting a neuron model to data with fine spatial resolution, such as that achievable with voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging.<h4>Result</h4>We apply our method to simulated data from layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) and construct a model with reduced neuronal morphology. We connect the reduced-morphology neurons into a network and validate against simulated data from a high-resolution L5PC network model.<h4>Comparison with existing methods</h4>Our approach combines features from several previously applied model-fitting strategies. The reduced-morphology neuron model obtained using our approach reliably reproduces the membrane-potential dynamics across the dendrites as predicted by the full-morphology model.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The network models produced using our method are cost-efficient and predict that interconnected L5PCs are able to amplify delta-range oscillatory inputs across a large range of network sizes and topologies, largely due to the medium after hyperpolarization mediated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated SK current.},

@article{Hines1984,
abstract = {Three simple improvements are presented which, for a given accuracy, result in a  10-20-fold decrease in computation time for simulation of arbitrarily branched active cables with Hodgkin Huxley (HH) kinetics. The first improvement takes advantage of the essentially tridiagonal character of the matrix equation for each branch of a 'tree' network and solves the equations as efficiently as for an unbranched cable. The second improvement evaluates the HH membrane conductances at the midpoint of a time step, delta t, to maintain full second order accuracy, 0(delta t2), with no increase in the number of computational steps. The third improvement makes use of 'premultiplied' HH rate function tables for very efficient second order correct integration of HH membrane conductance.},
