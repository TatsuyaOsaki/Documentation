* **00005** : Can't detect board in hardware manager (linux)

Because of required root access to install drivers, cable drivers on linux aren't install by installer so as you need to install them on your own

```Bash
cd {vivado_install_dir}/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/
sudo ./install_drivers
```

* **00006** : Can't connect serial port, permission denied (linux)

Usually, the user has restricted access rights on serial ports or USB. A quick workaround is to add the device port to the user group.

```Bash
sudo chown <username> <serial port>
```

Another workaround is to elevate user's privileges on devices ports but it requires more steps.
